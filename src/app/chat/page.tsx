          Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pok√©mon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the
          tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures
          protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth
          is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out
          from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing
          membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white
          claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long,
          tapering tail burns with a sizable flame. As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit,
          though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and limb has three white claws. It
